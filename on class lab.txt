Task: R47 - Assign Duty Type Code
Actor: Roster manager
Purpose: Assign appropriate duty type codes (e.g., "First Duty," "End Duty") to employees to streamline scheduling.

Sub-tasks:

Select an employee from the roster.
Problem: Large rosters make searching cumbersome.
Example Solution: Implement a search feature with filters (e.g., by name, department, or ID) to quickly locate employees.
Assign a pre-defined duty type code.
Problem: Risk of assigning invalid or unsupported codes.
Example Solution: Use a drop-down list of valid duty codes, preventing unsupported or duplicate entries.
Save the assignment and validate.
Problem: No feedback on successful or failed assignments.
Example Solution: Display a confirmation message ("Duty Type assigned successfully") or error ("Failed: Invalid Duty Code") after saving.
Variants:

1a. Duty type is assigned successfully and appears on the roster.
1b. Invalid duty code entered (e.g., unsupported characters).
1c. Duty code is left blank (error handling).
1d. Duplicate duty type assigned to the same employee for the same day.
Task: R475 - Calculate Financial Impact
Actor: Roster manager
Purpose: Calculate the total hours and monetary cost of a given duty roster for payroll or budget purposes.

Sub-tasks:

Input hourly rates and roster details.
Problem: Missing or inconsistent hourly rate data.
Example Solution: Validate input fields and flag missing hourly rates with a warning (e.g., "Hourly rate required for Employee ID 101").
Compute total hours worked by all employees.
Problem: Errors in data processing for large rosters.
Example Solution: Optimize calculations for efficiency and include a progress indicator for rosters with 1,000+ employees.
Multiply total hours by hourly rates and display costs.
Problem: Results not presented in an easily interpretable format.
Example Solution: Present the financial summary in a table format, with subtotals for departments and an overall total.
Variants:

2a. All employees have uniform hourly rates.
2b. Employees have different hourly rates based on roles.
2c. Hourly rate is missing for one or more employees.
2d. Hours worked exceed expected limits (e.g., overtime scenarios).
Task: R479 - Notify Use of Temporary Worker Beyond Three Months
Actor: Roster manager
Purpose: Ensure compliance with regulations by alerting users when a temporary worker’s schedule exceeds three months.

Sub-tasks:

Track the start and end dates of all temporary workers.
Problem: Missing or incorrect start dates in worker profiles.
Example Solution: Validate profiles during entry and prompt corrections for missing or incorrect dates.
Compare dates to identify workers exceeding the three-month threshold.
Problem: Lack of automated alerts for compliance violations.
Example Solution: Use a background job to flag workers approaching the threshold and generate an alert.
Notify the manager with worker details and compliance warnings.
Problem: Notifications may lack actionable information.
Example Solution: Include specific details in alerts (e.g., "Worker ID 302 exceeds limit. Contract started on 01-01-2024.") with resolution steps.
Variants:

3a. One temporary worker exceeds three months.
3b. Multiple temporary workers exceed three months.
3c. Start or end date missing for a temporary worker.
3d. Worker’s contract end date is extended past three months without updates in the system.
Task: R669 - Error Messaging and Guidance
Actor: Roster manager
Purpose: Provide clear error messages and actionable guidance to resolve issues during scheduling or calculations.

Sub-tasks:

Detect errors in data input or processing.
Problem: Ambiguous or generic error messages confuse users.
Example Solution: Use specific messages like "Error: Employee ID 205 missing in roster" instead of generic errors.
Display a detailed error message.
Problem: Lack of resolution steps included in the message.
Example Solution: Pair error messages with actionable guidance, e.g., "Please go to Employee Profiles to update missing data."
Link the user to relevant help documentation.
Problem: No integration between error messages and help resources.
Example Solution: Include a “Learn More” button that opens the relevant help topic directly.
Variants:

4a. Missing or invalid input (e.g., blank duty code, incorrect hourly rate).
4b. System-related errors (e.g., backend failure, database connection issues).
4c. Incorrect format for required fields (e.g., letters in numeric fields).
4d. Overlapping shift timings for an employee.
Task: R700 - Generate Reports
Actor: Roster manager
Purpose: Export detailed reports of duty rosters, financial calculations, and compliance alerts for audits and payroll.

Sub-tasks:

Select the reporting period and scope (e.g., weekly, monthly).
Problem: Complex filtering options make selection difficult.
Example Solution: Provide pre-defined filters for common reporting periods like "Last Week" or "Current Month."
Generate the report in a chosen format (e.g., PDF, Excel).
Problem: Formatting inconsistencies across reports.
Example Solution: Standardize report layouts and allow users to preview before final export.
Validate the data and share the report.
Problem: Errors in shared data or missing details.
Example Solution: Include a validation summary indicating errors or missing fields before sharing reports.
Variants:

5a. Generate a standard report for a one-week roster.
5b. Export customized reports for specific departments or time frames.
5c. Missing or incomplete data in the roster results in errors.
5d. Large report sizes exceed system capacity (e.g., export failure).
